## Marrow Eater (Cunning)

The hungry wolf makes the most of his every meal.

**Cost:** None\
**Duration:** Permanent

The werewolf gains twice the normal amount of Essence from consuming human or wolf flesh.

## Essence Surge (Glory)

This Facet grants the Uratha the strength to cross between worlds in the blink of an eye.

**Cost:** 1 Essence\
**Action:** Reflexive

By using this Facet when Reaching across the Gauntlet, the werewolf may add his Glory to the dice pool for crossing over and, if successful, transitions instantly across. On an exceptional success, he regains the point of Essence spent to activate Essence Surge.

## River of Essence (Honor)

With this Facet, the werewolf may offer his packmates the very Essence of his being.

**Cost:** None\
**Action:** Instant

By touching a packmate and using this Facet, the werewolf may transfer Essence at a rate of 1 point per turn. He may offer a maximum of Essence points equal to his Honor Renown each day in this way. Attempting to use River of Essence on a packmate without an Essence pool causes the Facet to fail.
Primeval Echo (Purity)

This Facet amplifies the echo of Urfarah within the werewolf’s spirit, letting him draw deeper upon his ancestral power.

**Cost:** None\
**Duration:** Permanent

The werewolf adds his Purity Renown to the maximum size of his Essence pool.

## Essence Sight (Wisdom)

The Uratha with this Facet can gaze into the channels of Essence that gouge through another being, and tell just how greatly her spiritual strength waxes or wanes.

**Cost:** 1 Essence\
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Occult + Wisdom – prey’s Composure\
**Action:** Reflexive

The werewolf may use Essence Sight against any prey that she can see.

#### Roll Results

**Dramatic Failure:** The Facet fails and the Uratha expends an additional point of Essence, which literally bleeds out of his eyes as visible, oozing ephemera before it evaporates.\
**Failure:** The Facet fails to take effect.\
**Success:** The werewolf can immediately tell how much Essence the prey has in her Essence pool. If she has no Essence pool, he merely receives the knowledge that she is at 0 Essence.\
**Exceptional Success:** The werewolf regains the point of Essence spent to activate this Gift.
