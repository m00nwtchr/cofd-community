[Source](http://theonyxpath.com/the-giver-of-gifts-1-werewolf-the-forsaken/)

This Gift is only available to Cahalith.

## Terrorizing Shriek (•)

Faced with the sudden and nightmarish presence of the Cahalith, the prey falters and hesitates.

**Cost:** None\
**Action:** Reflexive

The Cahalith howls upon launching an ambush or entering combat. If she uses this Facet when launching a surprise attack or ambush, she inflicts her Glory as a penalty on the prey’s Wits + Composure roll to respond during the first round. She also inflicts her Glory as a penalty on the Initiative rolls of all prey, whether as part of an ambush or not, and this effect lasts for the duration of the combat. Any prey whose Initiative score is below that of the Cahalith gains the Shaken Condition.

## Voice of Fear (••)

The lash of the Cahalith’s tongue instills fear and madness.

**Cost:** 1 Essence\
**Action:** Instant\
**Duration:** 1 scene

The Cahalith adds her Glory Renown to all her dice pools for Intimidate. Additionally, she may benefit from one of the following effects once per scene:

- If she achieves an exceptional success when intimidating prey, she may inflict the Shaken Condition on him.
- If she successfully intimidates prey suffering the Shaken Condition, she may replace Shaken with the Fugue or Madness Conditions instead.
- If she successfully intimidates prey suffering the Fugue or Madness Conditions, she may immediately trigger the Fugue effect or force any remaining Madness penalty for the chapter on the next Mental or Social roll he attempts.

## Mad-Eyed Hunter (•••)

Neither desperate flight nor secure hiding place offers the prey any solace from the maddening echoes of the hunter’s howls.

This Facet can only be activated when the Cahalith gains the Siskur-Dah Condition.

**Cost:** 1 Essence\
**Action:** Instant\
**Duration:** The full duration of Siskur-Dah

For the duration of the Facet’s effects, the Cahalith applies her Glory Renown as a penalty to any breaking point dice pools that any prey suffer in her presence, as long as she is taking actions to pursue the Siskur-Dah‘s prey. Prey that succeeds at resisting Lunacy always gains the Shaken Condition, and prey that fails suffers the Madness or Fugue Conditions instead of Atavism, Delusion or Reception. Additionally, non-werewolf prey whose Composure is equal to or less than the Cahalith’s Glory Renown suffer from Lunacy even if they would not normally be subject to it, including spirits, Claimed and other supernatural entities.

## Nightmare Spiral (••••)

The fracture lines of fear and madness spread through the mind, letting the werewolf break or remake her prey as she sees fit.

**Cost:** 2 Essence\
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy + Glory vs. Composure + Primal Urge\
**Action:** Instant

The Cahalith may use Nightmare Spiral against any prey she can perceive.

### Roll Results

**Dramatic Failure:** The Cahalith immediately gains the Madness Condition.\
**Failure:** The Facet has no effect.\
**Success:** If the prey has failed a breaking point since the last time the gibbous moon rose, he immediately fails another breaking point. For a werewolf, this breaking point is towards Spirit or Flesh as per the last breaking point he suffered. A victim can only suffer this effect of Nightmare Spiral once per month. Nightmare Spiral has two additional effects that can be used more freely, depending on the state of the prey:

- If the prey has the Madness Condition, the werewolf may immediately replace it with the Amnesia Condition.
- If the prey has the Fugue Condition, the Cahalith may immediately trigger the fugue, and furthermore may send forth her own mind to ride the victim until the sun next rises. She may immerse her senses into those of the prey and may let him take his own course, or can directly seize control. While riding the prey, she cannot perceive with her own senses and seems to be in a state of deep sleep. Ending the Facet is an instant action and returns her consciousness to her own body. Should the prey be killed while the werewolf is riding, she is ejected back to her own body and immediately fails a breaking point towards Spirit. Should the Uratha be slain while she is riding, a fragment of her spirit becomes subsumed into the prey. This may create a unique Claimed, or she may end up as an imprisoned personality only rising to the surface when the victim suffers the fugue state.\

**Exceptional Success:** The Cahalith also gains the Inspired Condition.

## Soul Shriek (•••••)

The Cahalith unleashes a banshee scream of raw, primal madness.

**Cost:** 3 Essence\
**Dice Pool:** Presence + Intimidate + Glory vs. Composure + Primal Urge\
**Action:** Instant

### Roll Results

**Dramatic Failure:** The Cahalith gains the Stunned Tilt.\
**Failure:** The Facet fails.\
**Success:** Any werewolf or spirit prey who hears the howl and fails to roll as many successes as the Cahalith is struck with the Essence Overload Condition. Other prey who fails to roll as many successes as the Cahalith suffers the Soulless Condition as his soul tears free from his body. Souls taken in this way are in the werewolf’s possession, appearing about her person as floating spirit-lanterns or shards of light that are visible when she flares her Renown or is in the Shadow. The Cahalith’s death or her willing agreement will restore the lost soul.\
**Exceptional Success:** Prey suffers the Enervated Condition rather than the Soulless Condition.
