# Gift of Cities

## City Eyes (Cunning)

The city has its own worn face of stone, steel and glass, through which the werewolf peers.

**Cost:** 1 Essence\
**Action:** Instant\
**Duration:** 1 scene

The werewolf touches a single building or structure and transfers her senses into it. For the duration of the effect, as long as she is touching the building, she can project her senses through any of the structure’s windows or other apertures, both inwards and outwards. She can project through up to her Cunning in windows at a given time, which may be anywhere on the building; as such, the werewolf could well be able to survey several different areas at the same time. She can immediately sense whether any person she sees is an inhabitant of the building or an intruder, and adds her Cunning to Empathy dice pools targeting inhabitants and to perception dice pools targeting intruders.

## Riot (Glory)

The werewolf’s howl sets the human hive abuzz.

**Cost:** 5 Essence\
**Action:** Instant\
**Duration:** Hours equal to Glory Renown

Once this Facet is used, a riot will spontaneously start within 100 yards of the werewolf’s current position as long as there are enough humans available to form one. A number of humans will find themselves drawn together and will begin the riot based on a seemingly natural trigger – someone’s anger will flare up about an injustice, seeing a representative of an authority that he resents or the surfacing of his Vice. The riot will rapidly snowball in size and rage across the area for its duration, likely causing significant destruction and disruption. Being caught up in the riot will seem natural for those involved, but this Facet offers no control or influence over the direction or purpose of the riot; it merely ensures that the riot will happen, and that it will be destructive and fierce.

## Faceless Crowd (Honor)

Though surrounded by his fellows, the prey finds no solace – only loneliness and despair.

**Cost:** 1 Essence\
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Subterfuge + Cunning – prey’s Composure\
**Action:** Instant

The werewolf may use Faceless Crowd against any prey she can perceive who is in a crowded area.

### Roll Results

**Dramatic Failure:** The werewolf gains the Ban Condition. She must wear as featureless a mask as she can acquire for the Condition’s duration.\
**Failure:** The Facet does not take effect.\
**Success:** For the duration of the scene, the prey dramatically fails any attempt to interact with human crowds, groups, or passers-by, as well as any solitary humans who do not already know him. Usually this dramatic failure will take the form of simply being ignored, as if he doesn’t exist, unless being noticed would actually be worse (such as if he were committing a crime, or picked someone who will react violently to his attention). Cries for help and pleas for aid go unheeded. Running, bloodied, down a street with several Hishu Uratha on his tail provokes no more than a brief glance. Drivers literally don’t see him until the last moment. Explicitly supernatural displays will trigger the crowd to notice what is going on, as will Lunacy, and those affected by Faceless Crowd will remember any other participants after the fact if prompted (such as the appearance of the Hishu who were on the victim’s trail).\
**Exceptional Success:** The prey additionally suffers the werewolf’s Honor Renown as a penalty to rolls to call upon Allies, Contacts and Retainers during the scene.

## Urban Predator (Purity)

The primal wolf has little to fear from the grinding gears of the city.

**Cost:** None\
**Duration:** Permanent

The werewolf reduces all damage dealt to her by collapsing buildings, moving vehicles, falling (as long as it is onto a structure or onto a constructed surface like a pavement or road), electrical discharges from power lines or faulty equipment, and other urban dangers by her Purity Renown. A collapsing building will never damage her last remaining point of health. This Facet does nothing to protect against actual weapons.

## Carve the City’s Flesh (Wisdom)

The Uratha’s talons split apart the very meat and bones of the city.

**Cost:** 2 Essence\
**Action:** Instant\
**Duration:** Until the next sunrise or sunset

While she is within a built-up area, the werewolf can use this Facet when touching a wall or building to create a temporary street, alley or other urban passageway up to 30 yards long per dot of her Wisdom Renown. Brick rumbles, concrete unfurls and fresh architecture rears up to bring the new street into existence. This may be a narrow alleyway, a road capable of taking a vehicle or a cul-de-sac depending on the whim of the creator. Any existing structures shuffle aside and squeeze up to make room for the interstitial newcomer. The world does not notice that the street exists – humans do not notice its appearance and assume it has always been there, it has no Shadow, and attempts to remotely view into it fail. When the created street ceases to exist, anyone in the street (and anything they have about them) is ejected back out into areas adjoining the temporary space. Anything left alone in the street disappears. An object that vanishes in this manner will turn up sooner or later somewhere else nearby, usually in an alley or dead-end.
